<h1>Asics scraping project</h1>
This is a project where we had to scrape a website that had over 100 items in a single category. I decided to do the womens shoes category on the site ASICS. I scraped 600 items from the category and seperate them by their type of product, along with scraping 11 attributes from the item themselves to put into the jl files.
